Place the scrcpy server asset here for offline packaged builds.

Bundled adb lives under `resources/adb/`.

Expected filename pattern:

- `scrcpy-server-v<version>`
- `scrcpy-server-v<version>.jar`

Example:

- `scrcpy-server-v3.3.4`

When present, the app will use this bundled file first and will not require
internet access on first run to start mirroring.
